# SQLite3 and PostgreSQL Storage Experiment

**Name:** Rachit S  
**Roll Number:** 24bcs10139

This report compares SQLite3 and PostgreSQL using the same simple `users`
table. I used 200,000 generated rows with four columns: `id`, `name`, `email`,
and `created_at`.

The query used for timing was `SELECT * FROM users;`. Query output was redirected
to `NUL` so the timings mostly reflect the database scan and client transfer,
not terminal rendering.

## Environment

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| SQLite version | 3.53.0 |
| PostgreSQL version | 17.4 |
| SQLite database file | `users_sqlite.db` |
| PostgreSQL database | `advdbms_lab` |
| Rows in `users` | 200,000 |

## Commands Used

### SQLite3

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode=OFF;
PRAGMA synchronous=OFF;

CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL
);

WITH RECURSIVE seq(n) AS (
  SELECT 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1 FROM seq WHERE n < 200000
)
INSERT INTO users (name, email, created_at)
SELECT 'User ' || n,
       'user' || n || '@example.com',
       datetime('now', '-' || (n % 365) || ' days')
FROM seq;

ANALYZE;
```

```sql
PRAGMA page_size;
PRAGMA page_count;
PRAGMA mmap_size;
PRAGMA mmap_size=268435456;
PRAGMA mmap_size;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

For file size and process checks, I used the Windows equivalents of `ls -lh`
and `ps aux | grep sqlite`:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem users_sqlite.db
Get-Process sqlite3
```

### PostgreSQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id integer PRIMARY KEY,
  name text NOT NULL,
  email text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamp NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO users (id, name, email, created_at)
SELECT n,
       'User ' || n,
       'user' || n || '@example.com',
       now() - ((n % 365) || ' days')::interval
FROM generate_series(1, 200000) AS n;

ANALYZE users;
```

```sql
SHOW block_size;
SHOW shared_buffers;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database())) AS database_size;
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('users')) AS users_table_size,
       pg_relation_size('users') AS users_table_bytes,
       pg_relation_size('users') / current_setting('block_size')::int AS users_page_count;
SELECT relpages FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'users';
```

Process check:

```powershell
Get-Process postgres
```

## Observations

### SQLite3

| Metric | Observation |
| --- | ---: |
| Database file size | 11.95 MB |
| Page size | 4,096 bytes |
| Page count | 3,058 |
| Initial `mmap_size` | 0 |
| Updated `mmap_size` | 268,435,456 bytes |

Timing for `SELECT * FROM users;`:

| Run | mmap off | mmap on |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 0.591 s | 0.548 s |
| 2 | 0.582 s | 0.535 s |
| 3 | 0.554 s | 0.528 s |
| 4 | 0.563 s | 0.542 s |
| 5 | 0.567 s | 0.590 s |
| Average | 0.571 s | 0.549 s |

Enabling mmap gave a small improvement on this dataset, but the difference was
not large. Since the database file is small and the runs are warm-cache runs, the
operating system cache already helps a lot.

### PostgreSQL

| Metric | Observation |
| --- | ---: |
| Database size | 27 MB |
| `users` table size | 15 MB |
| Page size / block size | 8,192 bytes |
| `users` page count | 1,870 |
| `shared_buffers` | 128 MB |

Timing for `SELECT * FROM users;`:

| Run | Time |
| ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 0.464 s |
| 2 | 0.446 s |
| 3 | 0.536 s |
| 4 | 0.432 s |
| 5 | 0.439 s |
| Average | 0.463 s |

PostgreSQL finished the full table scan faster in this run. It also uses a
larger page size than SQLite, so the same logical dataset took fewer table pages.

## Comparison Analysis

| Area | SQLite3 | PostgreSQL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page size | 4 KB | 8 KB |
| Page count for `users` data | 3,058 database pages | 1,870 table pages |
| Query timing average | 0.549 s with mmap, 0.571 s without mmap | 0.463 s |
| mmap impact | Slight improvement after setting `mmap_size` to 256 MB | No direct SQLite-style `mmap_size` setting |

SQLite is lightweight and stores the whole database in one file, which makes it
easy to inspect with file-level commands. Its `mmap_size` setting can help by
allowing memory-mapped reads, but the benefit depends on file size, cache state,
and workload.

PostgreSQL has more storage overhead because it manages a full server process,
catalogs, relation files, and shared buffers. In return, it provides a stronger
buffer manager, concurrent access support, and more tuning options. For this
simple scan, PostgreSQL was faster on my machine even though the total database
size was larger.

The main takeaway is that SQLite is simpler and very efficient for local embedded
use, while PostgreSQL is better suited when the workload needs a server database
with concurrency, memory management, and operational controls.
